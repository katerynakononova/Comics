Inspired by Jean-Pierre Petit's accessible approach to science communication, "Machine Learning for Humans on Cats" aims to simplify the complex world of machine learning (ML) for a wide audience.

The book uniquely bridges the gap between complex technological concepts and engaging, accessible learning. It goes beyond traditional educational content by not only demystifying ML through the quirky yet informative perspective of feline characters but also by guiding readers through the practical aspects of interacting with AI to create ML models. 

This innovative narrative includes an introduction to 'prompt engineering', a critical skill in the era of generative AI, and teaches readers how to communicate with AI systems to achieve desired outcomes effectively. 

Illustrated with AI-generated art, this book is a source of inspiration that encourages readers to explore the possibilities of AI.

This book appeals to a wide range of audiences - from young adults and adults venturing into the world of ML for the first time to tech enthusiasts outside the AI field who want to stay ahead of technological trends or incorporate ML insights into their projects or careers. It is tailored for students and educators interested in understanding AI and ML without a deep technical background. It is also aimed at hobbyists and general readers outside the tech industry who are curious about AI and machine learning.
